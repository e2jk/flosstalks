        <h2>About FLOSS Talks</h2>
        <p>There are so many interesting projects out there that it can sometimes be difficult to discover new ones. By providing a central place to get audio and video content about <abbr class="initialism" title="Free/Libre/Open-Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> projects, we hope to contribute to the promotion of these projects.</p>
        
        <p>
            For a large number of projects, the content (such as project description, logo, url) has been retrieved from Ohloh:

        <h2>History of FLOSS Talks</h2>
        <p>FLOSS Talks was started by <a href="http://emilien.klein.st/">Emilien Klein</a>. While preparing a presentation about <a href="/freenas">FreeNAS</a> for our monthly <a href="http://lug.project073.nl/">Den Bosch LUG</a> meeting, I searched for a list of podcasts that would present that same project. As I didn't encounter it, I decided to create it ;)</p>

    <h2>Technical information</h2>
    <p>
        The website is created using the <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> static site generator. It started as a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> application, but since all the content really just is static, it was ported over to Pelican, which allows us to run it on a very under-powered webserver ;)
        It is written using mainly <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html">reStructuredText</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, and uses <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> / <a href="http://initializr.com/">Initializr</a> / <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>.
        The icons used on the site are graciously provided by <a href="http://glyphicons.com">Glyphicons</a>.
